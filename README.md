How to Clone Me
---------------
This repo includes vendored third-party code, so it must be git cloned in a specific way:

```
> cd $GOPATH
> git clone git@github.com:10XDev/mario.git src --recursive
```
Make sure to clone into a folder named `src` directly under your `$GOPATH`, not into a folder named `mario`.
